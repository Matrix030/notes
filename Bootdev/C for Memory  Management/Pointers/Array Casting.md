Let's explore a special kind of psychopathy that's possible in C. Let's assume we have this array of 3 structs where each struct holds 3 integers:

```c
coordinate_t points[3] = {
  {5, 4, 1},
  {7, 3, 2},
  {9, 6, 8}
};
```

Because arrays are basically just pointers (in most cases; more on that later), and we know that structs are contiguous in memory, we can cast the array of structs to an array of integers:

```c
int *points_start = (int *)points;
```

Then we can iterate over the known number of integers in the array of structs:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  printf("points_start[%d] = %d\n", i, points_start[i]);
}
/*
points_start[0] = 5
points_start[1] = 4
points_start[2] = 1
points_start[3] = 7
points_start[4] = 3
points_start[5] = 2
points_start[6] = 9
points_start[7] = 6
points_start[8] = 8
*/
```
